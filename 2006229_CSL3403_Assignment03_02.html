        In this modern era, internet has become need of every bit of life. It has changed the way of living of human beings and has transformed old era of less access and facilities to a fully accessed and luxurious one. It has enclosed whole world in a box in which everything is easily accessible. Internet is another milestone of science which has two faces, one is its advantages and another is its disadvantages in daily life of humans. Let me start with its advantages.
      </p>
      <h3>Advantages</h3> 
      <p class="ad">
        Modern man is handicapped without internet. Internet has limitless advantages in our daily life. Its advantages start with Google or other search engines which enable us to search any kind of information. Information, News or pictures of almost whole world can be easily accessed by man while just sitting on chair or laying in bed. Today no student, who is accessible to internet, is left behind due to lack of study material or guidance. Internet is a source of every kind of information about every kind of subject. There are lectures of top most teachers of every subject available in internet which could be accessed by any student. Also teachers deliver their lectures to their students sitting across world through video conference from one place at a time. These all things have made internet a boon in field of education. Internet is playing a major role in integrating or exchanging cultures of world. It has enabled us to reach out to the culture of any part of world. Internet is used by governments of many countries as a medium to promote their culture. Information about heritages or wonders of world is easily available in internet.

      <h3>Disadvantages</h3>
      <p class="sd">
        When we say disadvantages, first thing that comes to mind is hacking. Hacking has created a sense of insecurity among internet users. Online money transfer has also become little insecure due to hacking. There are other illegal acts like phishing, vishing and smishing which are defaming internet.
